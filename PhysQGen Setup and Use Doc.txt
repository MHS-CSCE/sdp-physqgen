Create Github Classroom Account with a link from Ms. Edwards.
	Use school email, click the Create Account button on the initial login screen, then go through prompts.
	Make sure to join the team PhysQGen so you can access the project files.

**Figure out VM

**Install git

Create a folder to contain the project on the VM.
Type "cmd" into the search bar and hit enter. This will open a command prompt in that location.
Then, type "git clone https://github.com/MHS-CSCE/sdp-physqgen". This will prompt you to login, I still have to figure out how to authorize you, but it'll probably work if you join my team for the project when you set up your account.
Once you go through the authorization process, the most up to date version of the repo will be downloaded in that folder. For now, it is named sdp-physgen.
